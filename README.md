# Pyano
A simple Keyboard-Piano emulator with realistic sound

# Setting it up
This script needs some things to work:  
1. It needs to have fluidsynth .dlls in the same directory.  
The dlls can be downloaded from https://www.fluidsynth.org/  
Just copy ALL .dlls from fluidsynth/bin folder to C:\Windows\System32 folder. 

2. Install pyFluidSynth, it can be installed with the command: ```pip install pyfluidsynth```

3. It needs a SoundFont. They can be downloaded from https://sites.google.com/site/soundfonts4u/  
Don't forget to change the name in the script to match the SoundFont name.  

4. The keys have to be configured to match personal preference.
